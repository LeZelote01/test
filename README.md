# QuantumGate - Post-Quantum Cryptography Solution

## Overview
QuantumGate is a comprehensive post-quantum cryptography solution designed to protect against quantum computing threats. It combines hybrid encryption, AI-powered threat detection, and blockchain integration to provide enterprise-grade security.

## Features

### 1. Hybrid Intelligent Cryptography
- **NIST Algorithms**: Implementation of Kyber (encryption) and Dilithium (signature) with ascending compatibility (RSA+ECC)
- **Dynamic Management**: AI system analyzes messages and automatically switches between algorithms (e.g., quantum attack detection)

### 2. Proactive Quantum Threat Detection
- **AI Analysis**: Uses Random Forest circulation model to detect anomalies in network requests
- **Auto-maintenance**: Updates protocols when vulnerabilities are detected, without manual intervention

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- **Smart Contracts**: Secured smart contracts in Solidity for transactions protected against quantum attacks
- **Local Compatibility**: Support for African blockchains like Afeni Blockchain

### 4. Light Infrastructure Tier
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Hybrid-tier algorithms (Lattice-based) with short keys to reduce bandwidth
- **Offline Mode**: Different synchronization for rural or low-connectivity areas

### 5. Bug Bounty Platform
- **Ethical Hacker Community**: Bug bounty program on post-quantum vulnerabilities with local rewards (e.g., tech project financing in Côte d'Ivoire)

### 6. Multilingual Assistant
- **Local Language Support**: Interface in French, English, Lingala, Kiswahili, etc.
- **Interactive Guides**: Simple explanation of cryptography concepts for SMEs and non-technical users

### 7. Security Gamification
- **Reward System**: Badges and points to encourage users to adopt secure practices (e.g., key updates)
- **Ethical Education**: Mini-games to learn cybersecurity basics

### 8. Regulatory Compliance
- **Local Standards**: Adaptation to future regulations of the African Union and ECOWAS
- **GDPR**: Personal data protection with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

### 9. Open Source Ecosystem
- **Public Code**: Version open-source on GitHub for universities and African developers
- **Incentives**: Grants for significant contributions (e.g., algorithm optimization)

### 10. Flexible Deployment
- **Cloud & Local**: Mixed deployment (AWS/Scaleway + local servers in Côte d'Ivoire)
- **Regional Networks**: Kubernetes deployment for region-specific optimization (Ghana, Kenya, etc.)
